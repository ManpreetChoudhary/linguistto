&lt;p&gt;Technology and internet services were created in order to surpass the communication barriers across the globe . Even then we have not been able to fully break the barriers of languages. Scientists and developers all over spend countless hours as well as resources in order to improve the robotic achievements of language translation activity. For example, in order to provide their users with new experiences, &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.twitter.com/es/using-twitter/translate-tweets&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/help/509936952489634?helpref=search&amp;amp;sr=4&amp;amp;query=traducci%C3%B3n&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; recently added translations that allow messages to be transformed into more than 40 languages when sent or received from their web pages or mobile applications. Google has also announced the development of ‘AutoML Translation’ as a way of improving the interpretative abilities of its translator in 27 dialects. The latest step forward for artificial intelligence is &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidebigdata.com/2018/09/14/neural-attention-please-attention-models-can-work/&quot;&gt;Neuro-Linguistic Programming&lt;/a&gt;, a technology that stimulates the human brain and tries to capture the meaning of phrases and words in their context in order to adapt them into a new language (Source: Cultureconnection.com).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still in the process of generating 100% artificial intelligence accuracy and larger establishments do not fully trust automatic machine and tool language translation and still hire professional human language translators for the task.There is no actual threat to the profession of several professional translators as the service provided by the machine are quite different from manual ones. Both the systems have their respective advantages as well as disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated vs Manual translation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/auto.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our country India is home to 122 languages out of which 22 are designated as official languages. The complexity of human languages make effective language translation a humongous task for tool developers. Although this seems quite a task still its importance is many as there has been increased demand in providing digitized translated content. Few parts of the globe has the need to generate translation tools in so many different languages, as is required in the Indian subcontinent. The top six languages spoken in India are Hindi, Bengali, Telegu, Tamil, Marathi and Urdu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With automated translation platforms changing the way information is spread and allowing for global interaction, there is no doubt that these tools play an integral role in developing cross-country communications, especially as they continue to improve. Online translation tools have increased and improved tenfold. In November of 2016, Google revealed a new version of Translate that employs a translation engine called &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.googleblog.com/2016/09/a-neural-network-for-machine.html&quot;&gt;Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT)&lt;/a&gt;. This system translates complete sentences using an artificial neural network. It links digital “neurons” in several layers, each one feeding its output to the next layer—a method loosely modeled after the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, new Google Translate began by translating eight European languages to and from English and then expanded to Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, and Vietnamese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has now extended neural translation to include nine Indian languages. No system can perfectly incorporate the efficiency of human translators therefore, there are still weaknesses to be addressed with the neural translation system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.transperfect.com/blog/why-automated-translation-cannot-replace-humans&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, users recently found that typing variations of the Latin text placeholder “Lorem Ipsum” into Google Translate yielded random English phrases. In all lowercase, “lorem ipsum” produced “China.” Capitalized correctly (“Lorem Ipsum”) became “NATO.” In all lowercase “lorem lorem” was “China’s Internet,” and so on. Internet users were perplexed by these cryptic messages, and soon after, Google had to correct these erroneous translations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the deadly combinations of words to amusing errors caused by the use of free translation software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For larger companies like Coca Cola, translating and localizing the marketing message helps to build a strong local presence in each market. It so happened to Coca-Cola that when the brand decided to mix English and te reo Māori, New Zealand’s indigenous language translation fail happened. The combination translates into the native language as “Hello, Death.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only Microsoft but also Google Translate can create hilarious situations, such as receiving 15,000 eggs, after placing the wrong order on a local website!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we compare languages like French or Spanish with our Indian languages we find that all languages in India do not follow standard script and are very complex to input and still be grammatically correct. Even Devanagari script is very complex to be standardized for its multiple languages on an input device like a keyboard. For example,Amitabh Bachchan on KBC (Kaun Banega Crorepati) asks viewers a question for winning 1 Lac, users are expected to send SMS KBCQ followed by options A, B, C or D. He then quickly announces that SMS in local languages will be accepted. How many users you think will send the answer as (केबीसी क्यू क, ख, ग, घ) or any other local Indian languages?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge of English to Indian Language - Syntactic Divergence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important structural difference in English and most of the Indian languages is the &lt;strong&gt;word order.&lt;/strong&gt; Since English uses the subject-verb-object order, and most of the Indian languages, primarily use subject-object-verb. Some of the Indian languages are of the nature of free word order. In the first example, we can see that word order “ate mango” becomes “mango ate” [&lt;em&gt;aama khaayaa&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of Different Word Orders in English and Hindi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists are constantly trying to improvise and recently we have seen since we have so many different languages clearly the researchers had to find a generalized approach that could be easily adapted from one language to another. It was in news recently that a multipart machine translation architecture, Sampark, is nearing its completion as the combined effort of 11 institutions led by the Language Technologies Research Center at the International Institute of Information Technology in Hyderabad (IIIT-H). Sampark combines both traditional rules- and dictionary-based algorithms with statistical machine learning, and will be rolled out to the public at &lt;a href=&quot;http://sampark.iiit.ac.in/&quot; title=&quot;http://sampark.iiit.ac.in/&quot;&gt;http://sampark.iiit.ac.in/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paraphrasing&lt;/strong&gt; a text means re writing a sentence or words without changing the original meaning of the same. The rewritten content consists of no duplicacy and hence is not plagiarized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differences in terms of plagiarism vs paraphrasing&lt;/strong&gt; lie in the closeness of your text to original one. You can define plagiarism as word-for-word copying, which is forbidden. Paraphrasing helps present the same ideas but it doesn’t repeat what was already written somewhere. That’s a great way of relying on someone’s text but not copying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ethical writer takes great care to ensure that any paraphrased text is sufficiently modified to new writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let use see few examples of &lt;a href=&quot;https://edubirdie.com/blog/paraphrasing-vs-plagiarism&quot;&gt;paraphrasing&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/differences.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/differences-2.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider various paraphrased versions of the following material on the electrochemical properties of neurons (taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ori.hhs.gov/education/products/roig_st_johns/Examples%20of%20paraphrasing.html&quot;&gt;Martini &amp;amp; Bartholomew, 1997&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original content :&lt;/strong&gt; “Because the intracellular concentration of potassium ions is relatively high, potassium ions tend to diffuse out of the cell. This movement is driven by the concentration gradient for potassium ions. Similarly, the concentration gradient for sodium ions tends to promote their movement into the cell. However, the cell membrane is significantly more permeable to potassium ions than to sodium ions. As a result, potassium ions diffuse out of the cell faster than sodium ions enter the cytoplasm. The cell therefore experiences a net loss of positive charges, and as a result the interior of the cell membrane contains an excess of negative charges, primarily from negatively charged proteins.”¹ (p. 204).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paraphrased content :&lt;/strong&gt; A textbook of anatomy and physiology¹ reports that the concentration of potassium ions inside of the cell is relatively high and, consequently, some potassium tends to escape out of the cell. Just the opposite occurs with sodium ions. Their concentration outside of the cell causes sodium ions to cross the membrane into the cell, but they do so at a slower rate. According to these authors, this is because the permeability of the cell membrane is such that it favors the movement of potassium relative to sodium ions. Because the rate of crossing for potassium ions that exit the cell is higher than that for sodium ions that enter the cell, the inside portion of the cell is left with an overload of negatively charged particles, namely, proteins that contain a negative charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to thoroughly changing much of the language and some of the structure of the original paragraph, the paraphrase also indicates, that the ideas contained in the rewritten version were taken from another source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in their attempts at paraphrasing, authors commit ‘near plagiarism’ because they fail to sufficiently modify the original text and thus, produce an inappropriately paraphrased version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inappropriate paraphrasing also happens sometimes by writers who are not adept at the technical know-how of the content. Therefore, the ability to properly paraphrase technical text depends in large part on the author’s conceptual understanding of the ideas being described and that author’s mastery and command of the technical language involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, inexperienced authors (e.g., students) have the greatest difficulty paraphrasing the advanced technical text often found in the primary literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, practice a two step process of paraphrasing an article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, understand the basic structure of the sentence. Sentences can be simple, compound or simple compound. Once you have identified the sentence structure, you can reconstruct the sentences keeping in mind the active voice and passive voice formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to distinguish your paraphrase from the original content is by working on the length of the sentences. Use short sentences and break them down into understandable and short sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, paraphrasing is not just about replacing right words here and there, it is about taking ideas and explaining them using various words in a manner where you are clearly able to express yourself to your reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let us now see the difference between plagiarism and paraphrasing correctly:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/differences-3.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/differences-4.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid plagiarism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quoting:&lt;/strong&gt; If you don’t want to alter the quotes, use quotation marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summarizing:&lt;/strong&gt; Simplify the content in your own words. This means once you have understood the meaning of the passage simply write a condensed synopsis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paraphrasing:&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to use a source’s information, restate it in your own words through “new wording and phrasing in just as many words or slightly more words than the original.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What requires citation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time you use information that is not common knowledge , cite them appropriately. Suppose you are using someone else’s quotes, illustrations, facts and figures you must credit the source. These may require permission and some of these may be copyrighted content too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common knowledge exception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common knowledge need not be cited. So what exactly is common knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The reader would already be aware of it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s a widely accepted fact; for example, there are 60 seconds in a minute.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s accessible via common information sources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It originates from folklore or a well-known story e.g. Ramayana, &lt;em&gt;Jataka&lt;/em&gt; tales.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s commonly acknowledged in your field and known by your audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid charges of plagiarism you must not only document your sources correctly using an appropriate style guide (eg Harvard or Vancouver) , but you must also handle direct quotations and citations correctly. In order to ensure that your content is free from plagiarized content, use free plagiarism checker tools available for free online. It takes time to develop the skills required to paraphrase content . Thinking of developing writing as a profession? Remember to paraphrase well and use plagiarism tools when necessary. We have created a handy tool list for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paraphrasing tool has a growing popularity owing to its ease of usage and generation of valuable and unique content for bloggers and digital content writers. A plagiarized content hampers the hard work by bloggers and creative content writers and these get penalized .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paraphrasing tools like Prepostseo and rephrase-tool come in quite handy for those who are often writing enormous amounts of content and require to sieve out plagiarized content and rephrase them quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what is a paraphrasing tool and why is it useful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paraphrasing is a Greek word that means “An Additional Manner of Expression”.The paraphrasing tool is a useful tool that allows one to change certain words or rewrite whole sentences- at ease. There is no uncertainty that paraphrasing tools allow you to present unique content that are easier to read and understand. Let us understand the impact of paraphrasing tools using this example below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunita couldn’t go to class because it was raining outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paraphrase tool- It was raining outside. Sunita couldn’t go to class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paraphrasing tool essentially summarizes the sentences by changing the structure and adding in relevant synonyms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is a paraphrasing tool required?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools gives you the freedom to construct sentences in a specific way. For example you copied some sentences from a website, these paraphrasing tools then reconstruct these sentences without changing the meaning of the same, so that you are handed with uniquely written content one that is not plagiarized. This means you can create new works from works already created by others. These tools are majorly used by bloggers and writers who have to reproduce content in bulk and need to save time as well as money. Your work is created within a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of paraphrasing for content writers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the top benefits for using these paraphrasing tools for writing your content:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These tools are widely available and you can access them from anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using the tools you could make all kinds of amendments from sentences in a school project to documenting scientific essays.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These tools are free to be used hence saving your business money.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These tools provide you with new content within a few seconds therefore saving your time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long written sentences can be cut short to understandable short sentences.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From spelling errors to syntactic errors, can be fixed using these tools.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These tools are very handy in detecting plagiarism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rewording quotes are not always easy but these paraphrasing tools make it easy for you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can summarize the whole content with this tool.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want to write meta tags for a page, the meta tags need to be specific among many of its competitors. They would replace the present phrases with new synonyms to make meta tags search engine optimization handier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since content is the key to generate more reader views, the paraphrasing tools can assist budding writers in generating more views.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most bloggers and social media enthusiasts use these tools before publishing their content online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developers who have built these tools have gone through massive amounts of research to understand plagiarism and paraphrasing in a very detailed way before the implementation of this tool. Since, paraphraser uses a giant database for its operation, hence there is no doubt, paraphrasing techniques refresh the sentences and statements with the purpose of making the core meaning clearer. Today these paraphrasing tools also support other languages apart from English therefore making it easily usable to other multilingual users. These tools assist professional writers, bloggers, students and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How paraphrasing tool helps students?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing assignments can be quite challenging for students who are not in the habit of writing much. A lot of students have no idea how to filter the content and use them in a proper manner. Paraphrasing is another challenging aspect that most students struggle with. Plus, a lot of college students have no idea about the evils of plagiarism. Since assignments have a submission deadline and producing low quality content or not submitting on time has resulted in drop of grades for many students. When a student is working on some important assignment he or she should avoid having any unwanted distraction while working. Since paraphrasing is a time consuming task , we would like to highlight the benefits of using technology for this problem. Every paraphrasing tool has a purpose and one must be aware before using it. If you a student who has to take the task of working on more than 10,000 words of content, these tools are a boon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some students do not properly reword the copied words and this can be dangerous as these get caught in plagiarism checker. Thus taking such dangerous chances is definitely not a good idea. Some paraphrasing tools are hard to use and students do not want to waste their precious hours in trying to learn how to use it. When you open the link of the tool of your choice, insert the copied material into the text box. Once you have completed the uploading process the tool generator will provide you with the changed content. After that students can download their assignments and submit it without further delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/content-writing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quillbot&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the best paraphrasing tools that can assist your writing in many ways. The final result of this tool will be 100% plagiarism free content. This tool smartly presents your content in such a way that neither plagiarism checker applications nor the human eye can catch it for duplication of content. This tool has the added perk of having a giant database for its operation. It picks up words from the database and inserts synonyms in the content as required. This is a tool where precision is at it’s best since the tool developers have thoroughly researched before creating this tool. The paraphrasing of Quillbot’s algorithm is quite complex. The tool comprehends your work in following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand the core meaning of your content and try to restructure it as close to the original content without changing the meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reshapes your sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make use of synonyms wherever possible and required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check for errors such as grammatical, spelling and even punctuations.&lt;/p&gt;

Now that I have captured your attention let us take a look at what it takes to don the hat of a content writer.&lt;/p&gt;
>>>>>>> 021cac60ed2776ddc018533a5954eb0dc13620ae

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are seven skills sets one must emulate in order to become an unmatched writer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Adaptibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem pretty obvious, but I have seen a lot of content that falls short of its task. It fails to engross the audience. For example, landing pages of a website should contain copy that is short and designed to persuade the reader to take action. Regarding tone, blog posts for a scientific equipment company targeting medical researchers will likely be much different from posts for an organic food shop targeting a wider range of health-conscious consumers. The more styles you adapt to the more adapted writer you become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.Research skills&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good research skills is the best way to generate high quality content. It is also important to find and include content only from trustworthy and reliable website and sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.Good understanding of SEO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good content writers stay on top with SEO trends. It is important to understand how to craft SEO friendly titles and keywords thus keeping up with the latest Google trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.Organizational skills&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping a calendar and knowing your deadlines is always the efficient and effective way. Turning on an important assignment late always sends a bad message to your clients. Prioritize your tasks and get them done promptly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.Staying focused&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing is a creative action and requires constant focus. Therefore when you initiate a writing task make sure to remove all possible distractions from you side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.Communication&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be tasks given to you that you are unfamiliar with. In order to deliver quality content it is important to communicate effectively with your clients and understand what they need from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.Editing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First drafts are rarely perfect. Therefore in order to have a polished content one must be patient, disciplined with eye for detail to sieve all errors from the content before sending it for publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now let’s understand the nitty gritty of how to become a good content writer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More or less everybody loves to write but very few of them take up professional writing and earn bread and butter from it. Many people are held back from utilizing their potential in creative writing as they suffer in self doubt. Therefore, we have enlisted some quick guiding tips that will enable you to work with improved proficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The scope of content writing is immense. With content writing there is no right or wrong. There are so many different types of content formats that you can specialise in ⁠— blog writing, SEO content writing, website content writing, copywriting, podcast scriptwriting, video scriptwriting, academic writing and many more. Each one comes with its own challenges and nuances. So, in the initial days, it is always better to narrow down your focus and navigate your areas of strength&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Huffington Post alone publishes nearly 2000 blog posts per day. So, irrespective of whether you are writing for a client or yourself, you need to make your content stand out. Here are a few tips to help you with this:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a content curation tool and try to understand the latest trends that are being written on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn to do content gap analysis by using various SEO tools.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You could also use free headline generators to get ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A content writer must do improved research in order to generate well written and summarized content. You could use tools like Evernote and EasyBib to write a drafted version of your content.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To be a successful content writer, you must understand the art of editing meticulously. A poorly drafted content with many errors will reduce your chances of retaining a client. Hence it is important you edit , proofread your content before publishing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analytical mind and good grasp over language is a must to be a successful writer. &lt;strong&gt;Let us look at some of the career options for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Freelancing is a great way to start your career. Companies are outsourcing their content writing to several independent writers these days. An abundant of such opportunities can be found on websites like Freelancer, Upwork and Fiverr.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are a school or college going student, you could also try out an internship. I remember the cheer my first article brought which was published in The Hindustan Times when I was 19 years old.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blogging is another independent and creative way to explore. Setting up your blog is free and since no qualifications are required you are free to write at your own pace. You only require a unique style of writing that resonates with the choices of your audience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a professional addition to your career, you could possibly explore various certification courses in writing. From Search Engine Optimization to Content Management System, these certifications teach everything. Such courses improve your writing skills and also competence in the market. There are a number of courses available in India and abroad which are both online and offline-TBS The Brand Salon, Mumbai, Digital Academy 360, Bangalore or Udemy Content Writing Course (Online)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips for aspiring content writers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
